# Weather-App

This is a simple web application that allows the user to input a location and get the current weather information for that location. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and displays it in a visually appealing format.

The HTML file contains a form with an input field for the location and a button to submit the form. When the user submits the form, the JavaScript file makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the user's input and displays the weather information in a dynamically created HTML element.

The CSS file contains styles for the web page, including the weather card and the form elements. The weather card has a background image that changes based on the current weather description and displays information such as the location name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.

Overall, this is a well-designed and functional weather application that provides a user-friendly interface to retrieve and display current weather information. The code is organized and easy to follow, making it easy to modify or add additional features in the future.
